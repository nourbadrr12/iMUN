	'What username and password?' you may be wondering.
	<br><br>

Well, once your payment is confirmed, you receive a username and password on your WhatsApp ( so make sure you give the correct number ) <br>
that you use in the 'registration' section of this website to register your information and choose your council.<br><br>

'Well how do i pay then?' U will definitely ask.<br>

There are 3 methods. 2 online and one offline.<br>
The offline method, simple and easy, just visit our school campus (location is in the map above) and inform the reception that you are here to pay for the iMUN conference who will then guide you to our financial office where you can pay and give some information. <br>

<br>The online methods are as follows:<br><br>

Number one: Vodafone cash where you will transfer the money to this number: 01097052000 <br>

Number two: Telda where you will transfer the money to this account: @nourbadr12 <br><br>

<br>'Well how much does a ticket cost?'
<br>-------
<br><br>
<b>
Note: to receive your username and password if u are paying online, you must take a pic/screenshot (as proof of payment) and send it to this number on WhatsApp: 01097052000 <br><br>

In Vodafone cash, we are aware you may have not paid from your personal mobile, therefore take a pic of the transaction and send it to this numberon WhatsApp: 01097052000<br><br>

In Telda, take the proof of payment pic/screenshot along with your fullname to this number on WhatsApp: 01092604545 <br><br>

If you are paying offline at INNOVATION INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL, you will have to give your phone number to the account and later that day we will send you your username and password.
